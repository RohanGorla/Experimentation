# Hi! Welcome to my coding lab!

Hi, I am Rohan. Welcome to my coding experimentation repository! This repository contains all my experimental coding files and coding concepts that I want to learn, including this readme file that I will be using to learn how to write better readme's!

## Type of files this repo will contain?

* Some useful code snippets.
* New things I learn about web dev or coding in general.
* Small but interesting chunks of big projects.
* New features/concepts that I want to work on etc...
